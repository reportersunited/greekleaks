# Greekleaks

[Greekleaks] is a whistleblowing platform that enables citizens to send
tips anonymously and securely to [Reporters United], a network of reporters
aiming to support investigative journalism in Greece.

This repository contains the landing page for the Greekleaks website, which
lists all the ways a whistleblower can contact the Reporters United journalists
(via SecureDrop, Signal, GPG Email, or by good ol' post). Also, it contains the
configuration files for deploying the website, as well as an [architectural
overview].

## How can I help?

We invite all users to contribute fixes for typos or other errors, either by
creating a GitHub pull request, or by [opening an issue].

For security-minded folks, we invite you to take a look at our [architectural
overview], and give us any feedback you may have about further hardening our
deployment.

If you want to deploy this site locally, follow our [deployment instructions].

## Can I use this for my own landing page?

Yes! This work is under the public domain, so you can use it as you please. Do
not hesitate to contact us if you want any help with setting it up.
