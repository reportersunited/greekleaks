        </header>
        <p>Greekleaks is an online platform that allows citizens to send messages, information and/or material (documents, videos, audio recordings, photos, etc.), anonymously and securely to Reporters United.</p>
            <p>Greekleaks was created by <a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reporters United</a> in cooperation with the <a href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://eellak.ellak.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Open Technologies Alliance GFOSS</a>.</p>

            <h1>WAYS TO USE GREEKLEAKS</h1>
            <h2>Choose the most appropriate way to send your message to greekleaks from the four options listed below.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Choosing the best way to send your message with greekleaks depends on several factors: how confident you are with technology; the type and volume of information you want to convey; and the nature of the person/entity who may have an interest in preventing the information from becoming public. This is because the level of security required to evade the surveillance capabilities of a modern state, for example, is much higher than that required to evade the watchful eye of an employer.</p>
        <p>Below are four different ways you can use greekleaks to communicate with Reporters United journalists.  Each method of communication has advantages and disadvantages which we explain in full below. We are committed to doing all we can to ensure that the information you share with greekleaks remains uncompromised, and to help you to choose the communication channel that is most appropriate for you. In order to communicate securely and anonymously, you must follow these guidelines carefully.</p>

        <p>Although it may seem outdated, sending mail through the Post Office is extremely secure. The only limitation is the amount of data you can send. Of course, as an alternative to paper documents, you can put a data storage device (such as a USB stick) in an envelope.</p>
        <p>By mail you can send your message to greekleaks at:</p>
        <p><b>P.O. BOX 13606</b></p>
        <p>If you want to contact a particular reporter on the Reporters United team, you can write their name on the envelope.</p>

            </header>
            <p>SecureDrop is the most secure way to share your story with us, but it does require a certain level of familiarity with technology.</p>
            <p>It is an open-source system that allows secure and anonymous communication with Reporters United to transfer information and/or material of public interest. It was created by the Brooklyn-based Freedom of the Press Foundation, where Edward Snowden is a member of the Board of Directors. SecureDrop is used by some of the world's largest news organisations (such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/en/contact/securedrop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mediapart</a>).</p>
            <p>Reporters United is the first and only organisation in Greece to install SecureDrop, in strict accordance with the protocol provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>
            <p>Through SecureDrop's servers, anyone can securely send messages, information and/or files without the recipient (in this case Reporters United) knowing the identity of the sender or details such as IP address and location. SecureDrop instead assigns a unique "code name" to the sender. The only information provided to the recipient is the date and time the message was sent, while the message itself is encrypted with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).</p>
            <p>SecureDrop preserves source anonymity using the Tor network to hide where messages came from. All communication is encrypted in transit and on our server. For additional security, all submissions we receive are decrypted on a device that is isolated from both the internet and our internal networks ("air-gapped").</p>

                        <li>Open the TOR browser, select "connect to TOR" and, once connected, copy and paste Reporters United's SecureDrop onion link address: <b>jatasaqcoe7lqdpcyxo7vl3e5tdvl5jgmtadfat77i25qdj6z6a4ulad.onion</b></li>
                        <li>From there, follow the instructions (which are also available in Greek) to connect to Reporters United's SecureDrop. If you are logging in for the first time, select "First Submission" and write down in a safe place the code name given to you. You will be able to use this code name if you want to log back in and send another message or view our response. In this case, the recipient will know that the message was sent by the same sender, but will still not know your identity.</li>
                        <li>If you are returning to Reporters United's SecureDrop, select "Return Visit" and enter the code name you received on your first visit.</li>
                        <li>You can now securely send us your message or any file of up to 500MB.

                        <li>Reporters United will decrypt and read each message offline. All messages and files submitted via SecureDrop will be deleted from the server at regular intervals. We recommend that you also delete any replies you receive from greekleaks once they have been read.</li>

        <p>It features advanced, end-to-end encryption. Unlike apps developed by large tech companies such as Meta's WhatsApp or Viber, Signal comes from an independent, non-profit organisation and uses open source code, a practice that is said to increase the security of communications. Edward Snowden <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Asnowden%20%40signalapp&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">has repeatedly praised</a> Signal and the security it provides, saying, "I use it every day and I'm not dead yet."

            <p>Sending an email to greekleaks (greekleaks@proton.me) can be done with a significant degree of security when done with PGP encryption.</p>
            <p>PGP stands for "Pretty Good Privacy". It is to date the most secure system for encrypting electronic mail, allowing files and messages to be exchanged while preventing the telecommunications provider from accessing the content of the email, and thus ensuring the confidentiality of the communication.</p>
            <p>PGP is based on the commonly accepted encryption technology 'public key cryptography', which requires the use of a public/private key pair to conduct secure communications. According to this method, the user must encrypt their message using the recipient's public key. The recipient in turn can decrypt the message using only their private key. In the event that the sender or the recipient does not know their respective key, the procedure fails. </p>
            <p>If implemented correctly, however, the PGP method encrypts the contents of messages during transmission in such a way that no one except the sender and the recipient are able to see them.</p>

The technology is built into the email sending/receiving system, so ProtonMail users don't need to do anything else to encrypt their email. This is the easiest method to communicate securely with Reporters United for those who are not particularly confident with technology.</li>
                        <li>If you don't have a Protonmail email account, it is easy to <a href="https://proton.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">create one</a>. Then send your email from there to <strong>greekleaks@proton.me</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Note: Do not fill in the "Subject" field of the email. Although the content is secure, this field may be read because the email provider has access to the metadata of the communication, i.e. the address of the sender and recipient, the subject of the message and the date of sending. The PGP encryption, however, prevents the provider from reading the content of your message.</li>

                <p>Greekleaks is the first platform for whistleblowers in Greece: it consists of an online platform that allows citizens, through the open source <a href="#securedrop">SecureDrop</a> system to anonymously and securely transmit messages and files (documents, videos, audio, photos, etc., and it also offers other secure communication options via more 'conventional' methods, such as the greekleaks <a href="#mail">P.O. box</a>, sending a message to the Reporters United <a href="#signal">Signal</a> number or sending an encrypted <a href="#pgp">PGP email</a> to our team.</p>

                <p>Greekleaks was developed by Reporters United in collaboration with the Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS) and the Brooklyn-based Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF), where Edward Snowden is a member of the Board of Directors. Journalists, developers and lawyers were involved in the development of the platform. FPF created SecureDrop, and specialises in creating systems for secure communication between sources and journalists. As such, they oversaw the entire development of the greekleaks platform, including both the website and the installation and operation of the SecureDrop system. GFOSS <a href="https://eellak.ellak.gr/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/10/%CE%A0%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%AF%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF-%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82-Reporters-United-%CE%95%CE%95%CE%9B%CE%9B%CE%91%CE%9A-v2-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carried out an external evaluation</a> of the project.</p>

                <p>Because, despite the fact that such platforms are widely used by the biggest media outlets in the world, there was still no platform in Greece allowing whistleblowers to securely share information with journalists. In modern journalism the role of whistleblowers and leaks is extremely important, as has been shown in recent large international stories such as the <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panama Papers</a> and the <a href="https://eic.network/projects/football-leaks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Football Leaks</a>, as well as Greek stories such as the Lagarde list and the wiretapping scandal.</p>
                <p>Through greekleaks <a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we</a> aim to provide a secure way for potential whistleblowers to leak information about wrongdoing in matters of public interest. More generally, and in cooperation with other bodies in Greece and abroad, we aim to stimulate public debate in Greece around the issue of public interest witnesses, journalistic ethics in dealing with leaks and the legal protection of sources.</p>

                <p>In November 2022, <a href="https://www.odigostoupoliti.eu/nomos-4990-2022-prostasia-prosopon-pou-anaferoun-paraviaseis-enosiakou-dikaiou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law 4990/2022</a> on the "Protection of persons who report breaches of EU law" was passed by Parliament, implementing <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L1937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU Directive 2019/1937 of the European Parliament</a> and of the Council of 23 October 2019 (L 305). This law constitutes the first framework legally protecting whistleblowers, or individuals who leak information about violations of EU law in the public or private sector, in Greece. However, despite this introduction of safeguards to prevent prosecution or retaliation against these public interest whistleblowers, concerns persist that the current legal framework does not do enough to protect whistleblowers.</p>
                <p>In November 2020, Reporters United, in collaboration with Transparency International Greece, Vouliwatch and 16 other organisations launched the <a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/1708/miliste-symmachia-organoseon-koinonias-politon-gia-tin-apotelesmatiki-prostasia-ton-whistleblowers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Speak-out initiative</a>. As part of this project, we sent a letter to the Prime Minister, urging that a strong, inclusive, progressive and modern institutional framework be created for the protection of whistleblowers. Whistleblowing has proven a powerful tool in preventing and combating actions that undermine the public interest. Unfortunately, the Greek government <a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/7220/i-elliniki-kyvernisi-afinei-aprostateytoys-toys-whistleblowers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chose to leave whistleblowers unprotected</a> by delaying the transposition of the European directive for two whole years. Even today, following the adoption of the bill, the implementation of the legislation needs careful monitoring.</p>
