            <h1>WHAT IS GREEKLEAKS?</h1>
            <h2>The first platform for whistleblowers in Greece</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Greekleaks is an online platform that enables citizens to
        communicate and send anonymously and securely messages and/or
        material (documents, videos, audio, photos, etc.) or just
        information to Reporters United journalists.</p>
        <p>Greekleaks was implemented by Reporters United in collaboration with
        EELLAK (Open Technologies Organization), which carried out the external
        evaluation of the project.</p>
        <p>The purpose of Reporters United is, through greekleaks, on the one
        hand to provide a useful tool to those looking for a safe way to
        disclose issues of public interest, and on the other hand – in
        cooperation with other organizations in Greece and abroad – to open the
        public debate in the country us on the issue of public interest
        witnesses, journalistic ethics in dealing with leaks and legal
        protection of sources.</p>

            <h1>CONTACT METHODS</h1>
            <h2>Choose how to send us your message at greekleaks</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Choosing the appropriate method of contacting greekleaks depends
        on many factors: your familiarity with technology issues, the type
        and amount of information you wish to convey, and the identity of
        the person who has an interest in keeping the information
        confidential. In other words, trying to avoid the "watchful eye" of
        an employer is a different matter than trying to avoid the control
        of intelligence services of a modern large state.</p>
        <p>Below we suggest four different ways to contact greekleaks and
        Reporters United network journalists. At this point, we must point
        out that the achievement of a secure and anonymous communication
        depends significantly on the observance of the instructions we have
        listed. Each method of communication has different characteristics
        and by extension different advantages and disadvantages. We are
        committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that the information
        you share with greekleaks is not compromised. The choice of the
        appropriate communication channel for you is yours.</p>

        <p>Mail seems to be the most outdated solution and yet it is extremely
        secure. The only limitation is the amount of data you can send. You can,
        of course, in addition to documents in paper form, put a data storage
        medium (eg USB stick) in an envelope. By mail you can send your message
        to the greekleaks PO Box:</p>
        <p>T.Th. 13606</p>
        <p>If you would like to address a specific reporter in the Reporters
        United community, you can note their name in the envelope.</p>

            <p>If you choose to communicate by traditional mail, it is advisable

            <ul>
                <li>Mail your message from a public mailbox and not from an ELTA store.</li>
                <li>Choose if you have the option of a prepaid envelope.</li>
                <li>Do not use a sender's name or address on the envelope. If
                    you want to let us know, you can note it in the contents of
                    the envelope or give us a signal number to contact you.</li>
                <li>Even documents in paper form can reveal information about the origin of a document, such as so-called <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/printers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">printer tracking dots</a> .</li>

            <p>SecureDrop is arguably the most secure but also the least
            straightforward of the suggested communication methods.</p>
            <p>It is an open source system that allows anyone to securely and
            anonymously communicate with Reporters United to convey information
            or material of public interest. It was created by the
            <a href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Freedom of the Press Foundation,</a>
            chaired by Edward Snowden. SecureDrop has been installed and is
            routinely used by some of the world's largest news organizations
            (from the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Reuters</em> to the
            <em>Guardian</em> and <em>Monde</em> ).</p>
            <p>Reporters United is the first and only organization in Greece
            (including Greek media) to install SecureDrop following the Freedom
            of the Press Foundation protocol step by step.</p>
            <p>Through SecureDrop's servers, anyone can securely send messages,
            information or even files, without the recipient (here Reporters
            United) knowing the identity of the sender or information such as
            their IP address and location . SecureDrop is designed to assign a
            unique "codename" to each user, with which they appear as the sender
            to the recipient. The only information shared with the recipient is
            the date and time the submitted message was sent, which includes GPG
            (GNU Privacy Guard) encrypted information and files sent by the
            user.</p>
            <p>A prerequisite for SecureDrop to work is access to it via the TOR
            network. All information is transferred encrypted through the TOR
            software which guarantees the anonymity of the user. For added
            security, decryption of sent files and/or messages is done
            exclusively on a Reporters United computer that has never been
            connected to the Internet ("air-gapped"). This is how we can
            guarantee the safe viewing of your messages.</p>

                            SecureDrop. If you are logging in for the first
                            time, select "First Submission" and note in a secure
                            place that only you will know, the code name that
                            will be given to you. You will be able to use this
                            code name if you want to log back in and resend a
                            message or see a reply from us. In this case, the
                            recipient will know that the message was sent by the
                            same sender, but without knowing your identity.</li>
                        <li>If you are returning to Reporters United's
                            SecureDrop, select Return Visit and then enter the
                            code name you received when you first
                            submitted.</li>
                        <li>You can now securely send us your message or any
                            files you want (up to 500Mb/file), or both. When
                            sent to us, data is encrypted and a secure
                            decryption process is followed by trained members of the
                            Reporters United team. Our team will review the message
                            and/or files you sent us and contact you via SecureDrop.
                            That is why it is important to keep the code name you will
                            receive during the first submission.</li>
                        <li>Journalists will decrypt and read offline each
                            message. Messages and all files submitted via
                            SecureDrop will be deleted from the server at
                            regular intervals.</li>
                        <li>We recommend that you also delete any responses you
                            may receive from greekleaks after they have been
                            read.</li>

                        <li>Finally, keep in mind that like any software,
                            SecureDrop can have bugs and no one can ever
                            guarantee 100% security. However, our team is

        is a very simple to use communication platform, through which you can
        talk, send messages (chat) or even attached files </p>
        <p>It features enhanced, end-to-end encryption. Unlike apps developed by
        big tech companies like Meta's WhatsApp or Viber, Signal comes from an
        independent, non-profit organization. It also uses open source, a
        practice that presumably increases the security of communication. Edward
        Snowden often speaks positively about Signal and the security it
        provides, even saying himself: "I use it every day and I haven't died
        yet."</p>
        <p>Unlike WhatsApp and Viber, Signal is committed to not retaining
        communication metadata.</p>

            <p>Sending email to greekleaks (
            <strong>greekleaks@proton.me</strong> ) can be done with a
            significant degree of security when done with PGP encryption.</p>
            <p>PGP stands for "Pretty Good Privacy". It
            he most secure electronic mail encryption system to date, which
            ws the exchange of files and messages, preventing the access of the
            communications provider and ensuring the confidentiality of the
            unication.</p>
            <p>PGP is based on the commonly accepted encryption technology "public
            key cryptography", which requires the use of a pair of keys
            (public-public / ate-private key) to conduct secure communications.
            According to this method, the user must encrypt his message using
            the recipient's public key. The recipient, in turn, can decrypt the
            message exclusively with his private key. In the event that one of
            the two keys is unknown, the above procedure fails.</p>
            <p>If implemented correctly, the PGP method encrypts the content of
            messages in transit in such a way that no one but the sender and
            recipient can see them.</p>

                        <li>A relatively simple way is to use a secure email
                            service such as ProtonMail
                            <a href="https://privacy.ellak.gr/2018/10/24/pos-na-stilete-asfali-email-me-to-protonmail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which</a>
                            provides the ability to send end-to-end PGP
                            encrypted emails between its users. The technology
                            is built into the email sending/receiving system, so
                            ProtonMail users don't need to do anything else to
                            encrypt their email. This is also the method that
                            facilitates the most for those who do not have detailed
                            technical knowledge.</li>
                        <li>If you do not have a Protonmail email, create an
                            account. Then send your email from there to
                            greekleaks@proton.me.</li>
                        <li>Note: Do not fill in the "Subject" field in the
                            email you are sending. The content may remain
                            secure, but often this field is readable. The email
                            provider has access to the metadata of the
                            communication, i.e.  the address of the sender and
                            recipient, the subject of the message and the date
                            of sending. But because of PGP encryption, the
                            provider cannot, even if they wanted to, read the
                            content of your message.</li>
                        <li>For extra security you can use ProtonMail <a href="https://proton.me/tor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">over the Tor network</a> .</li>

                <p>Because simply no one else in Greece had done it until now. The paradox is that this is a widespread practice, used by the largest media in the world. And yet, no media in Greece has so far used such a platform, even though in modern journalism the role of <strong>whistleblowers</strong> (witnesses of public interest) and leaks is extremely important, as has been proven in international cases ( <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panama Papers</a> , <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paradise Papers</a> , etc.), but also of Greek interest (Lagarde list, wiretapping case).</p>

                public interest witnesses, journalistic ethics in dealing with leaks

                <p>In November 2022, with a delay of almost a year, <a href="https://www.odigostoupoliti.eu/nomos-4990-2022-prostasia-prosopon-pou-anaferoun-paraviaseis-enosiakou-dikaiou/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Law 4990/2022</a>
                on the "Protection of persons who report violations of EU law" was
                passed in the Parliament, which in essence is an integration of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/?uri%3DCELEX%253A32019L1937" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Directive (EU) 2019/1937</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 (L 305). The passing of the law creates a <strong>first network of protection for public interest witnesses in Greece</strong> (whistleblowers) who report violations of EU law in the public and private sectors. However,
                despite the introduction of safeguards to avoid prosecution or
                retaliation, there are strong concerns that the bill passed does not
                fully cover public interest cases.</p>
                <p>In November 2020, Reporters United, in collaboration with
                International Transparency Greece, Vouliwatch and 16 other
                organizations launched the <a

                In this context, a letter was sent to the Prime Minister for the
                formation of a strong, inclusive, progressive and modern
                institutional framework for the protection of whistleblowers.
                This is because whistleblowing has proven to be a powerful tool

                by delaying the implementation of the European directive for two
                whole years. Even today, after the passing of the bill, it is

                legislation.</p>
