            <h1>WAYS TO USE GREEKLEAKS</h1>
            <h2>Choose the most appropriate way to send your message to greekleaks from the four options listed below.</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Choosing the best way to send your message with greekleaks depends on several factors: how confident you are with technology; the type and volume of information you want to convey; and the nature of the person/entity who may have an interest in preventing the information from becoming public. This is because the level of security required to evade the surveillance capabilities of a modern state, for example, is much higher than that required to evade the watchful eye of an employer.</p>
        <p>Below are four different ways you can use greekleaks to communicate with Reporters United journalists.  Each method of communication has advantages and disadvantages which we explain in full below. We are committed to doing all we can to ensure that the information you share with greekleaks remains uncompromised, and to help you to choose the communication channel that is most appropriate for you. In order to communicate securely and anonymously, you must follow these guidelines carefully.</p>

        <p>Although it may seem outdated, sending mail through the Post Office is extremely secure. The only limitation is the amount of data you can send. Of course, as an alternative to paper documents, you can put a data storage device (such as a USB stick) in an envelope.</p>
        <p>By mail you can send your message to greekleaks at:</p>
        <p>P.O. BOX 13606</p>
        <p>If you want to contact a particular reporter on the Reporters United team, you can write their name on the envelope.</p>

            <p>SecureDrop is the most secure way to share your story with us, but it does require a certain level of familiarity with technology.</p>
            <p>It is an open-source system that allows secure and anonymous communication with Reporters United to transfer information and/or material of public interest. It was created by the San Francisco-based Freedom of the Press Foundation, of which Edward Snowden is president. SecureDrop is used by some of the world's largest news organisations (such as the New York Times, The Guardian and Mediapart).</p>
            <p>Reporters United is the first and only organisation in Greece to install SecureDrop, in strict accordance with the protocol provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</p>
            <p>Through SecureDrop's servers, anyone can securely send messages, information and/or files without the recipient (in this case Reporters United) knowing the identity of the sender or details such as IP address and location. SecureDrop instead assigns a unique "code name" to the sender. The only information provided to the recipient is the date and time the message was sent, and the message itself is encrypted with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).</p>
            <p>SecureDrop preserves source anonymity using the Tor network to hide where messages came from. All communication is encrypted in transit and on our server. For additional security, all submissions we receive are decrypted on a device that is isolated from both the internet and our internal networks ("air-gapped").</p>

        <p>Signal is a very simple communication platform, through which you can talk, send messages (chat) and attach files.</p>
        <p>It features advanced, end-to-end encryption. Unlike apps developed by large tech companies such as Meta's WhatsApp or Viber, Signal comes from an independent, non-profit organisation and uses open source code, a practice that is said to increase the security of communications. Edward Snowden has repeatedly praised Signal and the security it provides, saying, "I use it every day and I'm still not dead."
</p>
        <p>Unlike WhatsApp and Viber, Signal is committed to not retaining the metadata of the communication.</p>
        <p>You can contact greekleaks by sending a message to the Signal number: <strong>+30 6981968309.</strong></p>

            <p>Sending an email to greekleaks (greekleaks@proton.me) can be done with a significant degree of security when done with PGP encryption.</p>
            <p>PGP stands for "Pretty Good Privacy". It is to date the most secure system for encrypting electronic mail, allowing files and messages to be exchanged while preventing the telecommunications provider from accessing the content of the email, and thus ensuring the confidentiality of the communication.</p>
            <p>PGP is based on the commonly accepted encryption technology 'public key cryptography', which requires the use of a public/private key pair to conduct secure communications. According to this method, the user must encrypt their message using the recipient's public key. The recipient in turn can decrypt the message using only their private key. In the event that the sender or the recipient does not know their respective key, the procedure fails. </p>
            <p>If implemented correctly, however, the PGP method encrypts the contents of messages during transmission in such a way that no one except the sender and the recipient are able to see them.</p>

The technology is built into the email sending/receiving system, so ProtonMail users don't need to do anything else to encrypt their email. This is the easiest method to communicate securely with Reporters United for those who are not particularly confident with technology.</li>
                        <li>If you don't have a Protonmail email account, it is easy to create one. Then send your email from there to greekleaks@proton.me.</li>
                        <li>Note: Do not fill in the "Subject" field of the email. Although the content is secure, this field may be read because the email provider has access to the metadata of the communication, i.e. the address of the sender and recipient, the subject of the message and the date of sending.

                <p>Greekleaks is the product of a collaboration between Reporters United and the Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS).</p>
                <p>Greekleaks was developed by Reporters United in collaboration with the Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS) and the Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF, chaired by Edward Snowden and based in San Francisco). Journalists, developers and lawyers were involved in the development of the platform. FPF created SecureDrop, and specialises in creating systems for secure communication between sources and journalists. As such, they oversaw the entire development of the greekleaks platform, including both the website and the installation and operation of the SecureDrop system. GFOSS carried out an external evaluation of the project.</p>

                <p>Because, despite the fact that such platforms are widely used by the biggest media outlets in the world, there was still no platform in Greece allowing whistleblowers to securely share information with journalists. In modern journalism the role of whistleblowers and leaks is extremely important, as has been shown in recent large international stories such as the Panama Papers and the Football Leaks, as well as Greek stories such as the Lagarde list and the wiretapping scandal.</p>
                <p>Through greekleaks we aim to provide a secure way for potential whistleblowers to leak information about wrongdoing in matters of public interest. More generally, and in cooperation with other bodies in Greece and abroad, we aim to stimulate public debate in Greece around the issue of public interest witnesses, journalistic ethics in dealing with leaks and the legal protection of sources.</p>

                <p>We can only speculate. They may not know that this technology exists, or it may appear overly complicated. Or perhaps it is simply a matter of differing priorities. It could also be down to a fear of receiving material that may come into conflict with the political and business relationships that many media outlets are dependent on.</p>

                <p>SecureDrop is to date considered unbreakable, but no one can guarantee 100% security. Its own FAQs states: <em>“While we can’t guarantee 100% security (no organisation or product can), the goal of SecureDrop is to create a significantly more secure environment for sources to share information than exists through normal digital channels. Of course, there are always risks. That said, each release of SecureDrop with major architectural changes goes through a security audit by a reputable third party security firm.”</em></p>
                <p>We must remind you that regardless of your level of familiarity with the technology, it is important to follow the guidelines carefully to achieve secure communication. We are committed to doing all we can to ensure that the information you share with greekleaks is not compromised in any way.</p>

                <span class="collapsible-icon"></span>
            </summary>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
                <p>In November 2022, Law 4990/2022 on the "Protection of persons who report breaches of EU law" was passed by Parliament, implementing EU Directive 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 (L 305). This law constitutes the first framework legally protecting whistleblowers, or individuals who leak information about violations of EU law in the public or private sector, in Greece. However, despite this introduction of safeguards to prevent prosecution or retaliation against these public interest whistleblowers, concerns persist that the current legal framework does not do enough to protect whistleblowers.</p>
                <p>In November 2020, Reporters United, in collaboration with Transparency International Greece, Vouliwatch and 16 other organisations launched the #Speak-out initiative. As part of this project, we sent a letter to the Prime Minister, urging that a strong, inclusive, progressive and modern institutional framework be created for the protection of whistleblowers. Whistleblowing has proven a powerful tool in preventing and combating actions that undermine the public interest. Unfortunately, the Greek government chose to leave whistleblowers unprotected by delaying the transposition of the European directive for two whole years. Even today, following the adoption of the bill, the implementation of the legislation needs careful monitoring.</p>

                <p>Even in the worst case scenario, that SecureDrop was seized by the authorities, there would be no trace of the messages or files we have received on the system (see above for more on this). If we were formally asked for information about the identity of a source, we would not be able to answer, because thanks to the way SecureDrop works, we would not know the identity of the source unless the source has chosen to disclose it to us. In any case, we pledge that we will not give the authorities any information about either our sources or the information they have chosen to share with greekleaks.</p>
