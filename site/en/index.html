            <p>Greekleaks is an online platform that allows citizens to send messages, information and/or material (documents, videos, audio recordings, photos, etc.), anonymously and securely to <a href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reporters United</a>.</p>
            <p>Greekleaks was created by Reporters United in cooperation with the Open Technologies Alliance (<a href="https://gfoss.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GFOSS</a>).</p>
            <p>Among other ways of communicating with whistleblowers, greekleaks uses the SecureDrop whistleblower submission system, adhering to the protocol of the <a href="https://freedom.press/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> (FPF) that currently manages SecureDrop.</p>

            <h2>Choose the most appropriate way to send your message to greekleaks.</h2>
        </header>
            <p>Choosing the best way to send your message with greekleaks depends on several factors: how confident you are with technology; the type and volume of information you want to convey; and the nature of the person/entity who may have an interest in preventing the information from becoming public.</p>
            <p>Below are four different ways you can use greekleaks to communicate with journalists from the Reporters United network. We are committed to doing all we can to ensure that the information you share with greekleaks remains uncompromised, and to help you to choose the communication channel that is most appropriate for you. In order to communicate securely and anonymously, you must follow these guidelines carefully.</p>

        <p>Although it may seem outdated, sending mail through the post office is considered secure. The only limitation is the amount of information you can send. Of course, as an alternative to paper documents, you can put a data storage device (i.e., a USB drive) in an envelope.</p>
        <p>Through the post office you can send your mail to greekleaks at the following address:</p>
        <div class="envelope">
            P.O. BOX 13606<br>
            Syntagma – Athens, 10563 – Greece

            </summary>
            <div class="collapsible-content">
            <p>If you choose to communicate by traditional mail, here are some additional precautions you can take:</p>
            <ul>
                <li aria-level="1">It would be best to not send your mail as registered mail, as this process would require you to give personal information to the Post Service.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Post your message from a public mailbox rather than the post office.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">If you are able to, use a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elta.gr/en/fakeloi-me-propliromeno-telos-2">prepaid envelope</a>.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Do not write the sender's name or address on the envelope. If you want us to have your contact details, provide them inside the envelope, or provide a telephone number so that we can contact you using the secure <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> application.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">If you want to contact a particular reporter from the Reporters United network, you can note their name on or inside the envelope.</li>
                <li aria-level="1">In case you are printing files to send to greekleaks, be careful with the printer you choose to use. Be aware that paper documents may reveal traces about the origin of a document, through the so-called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.eff.org/issues/printers">printer tracking dots.</a></li>

            </header>
            <p>SecureDrop is the most secure way to share your information with us, but it does require a certain level of familiarity with technology.</p>
            <p>It is an open-source whistleblower submission system that allows to share securely and anonymously information of public interest with Reporters United. It was created by Freedom of the Press Foundation, where Edward Snowden is a member of the Board of Directors. SecureDrop is used by some of the world's leading news organizations and investigative journalism platforms (such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/tips">New York Times</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/securedrop">The Guardian</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mediapart.fr/en/contact/securedrop">Mediapart</a>).</p>
            <p>Reporters United is the first and only organization in Greece to install SecureDrop, in strict accordance with the protocol provided by the Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF). After careful review, FPF included Reporters United in the global directory of media organizations that have active SecureDrop instances.</p>
            <p>Through SecureDrop's servers, anyone can securely send messages, information and/or files without the recipient (in this case Reporters United) knowing the identity of the sender or details such as IP address and location. SecureDrop instead assigns a unique "code name" to the sender. The only information provided to the recipient is the date and time the message was sent, while the message itself is encrypted with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard).</p>
            <p>A prerequisite to use SecureDrop is accessing it over the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tor network</a>, and from a computer to which only the user has exclusive access (for example, not an employer-provided device). All information is transferred encrypted through the Tor software that guarantees the user's anonymity. For additional security, all submissions we receive are decrypted on a device that is isolated from both the internet and our internal networks ("air-gapped").</p>

                        <li aria-level="1">You can now securely send us your message or any file of up to 500MB. Your data is encrypted by the software and will be securely decrypted by trained members of the Reporters United team.

The messages can only be accessed using your code name, so it's important you keep that secure from the start.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Reporters United will decrypt and read each message offline. All messages and files submitted via SecureDrop will be deleted from the server at regular intervals.</li>

                        <li aria-level="1">To protect your anonymity when using SecureDrop, it is essential that you do not use a network or device that can easily be traced back to your real identity. Instead, use public wifi networks and devices you control. This means, you should not access SecureDrop on your employer's network, and/or using your employer's hardware, or your home network.

                        <li aria-level="1">Similarly, if a third party has gained access to your computer, using SecureDrop will not ensure your security.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">Do not use the onion link in any browser other than Tor. It will not work, and it will leave an electronic trail behind.</li>
                        <li aria-level="1">For even more security, you can use an alternate operating system like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tails.net/">Tails</a>, which boots from a USB drive and erases your activity at the end of every session.

                        <li aria-level="1">Finally, keep in mind that like any software, SecureDrop can experience problems, and no one can ever guarantee 100% secure transmissions.

            <p>Sending an email to greekleaks (<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="mailto:greekleaks@proton.me">greekleaks@proton.me</a>) can be done with a significant degree of security when done with PGP encryption.</p>
            <p>PGP stands for "Pretty Good Privacy". It is to date the most secure system for encrypting electronic mail, allowing files and messages to be exchanged while preventing the telecommunications provider from accessing the content of the email, and thus ensuring the confidentiality of the communication.</p>
            <p>PGP is based on the commonly accepted encryption technology "public key cryptography", which requires the use of a public/private key pair to conduct secure communications. According to this method, the user must encrypt their message using the recipient's public key. The recipient in turn can decrypt the message using only their private key. In the event that the sender or the recipient does not know their respective key, the procedure fails.</p>
            <p>If implemented correctly, however, the PGP method encrypts the contents of messages during transmission in such a way that no one except the sender and the recipient are able to see them.</p>

                        <li aria-level="1">Do not fill in the "Subject" field in the email. Although the content of the email is secure when using PGP, the email provider still has access to the metadata of the communication, i.e., the address of the sender and recipient, the subject of the message and the date of sending.</li>

                <p>Greekleaks is the product of a collaboration between Reporters United and the Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS).

                <p>Because, despite the fact that such platforms are widely used by the biggest media outlets in the world, there was still no platform in Greece allowing whistleblowers to securely share information with journalists. In modern journalism the role of whistleblowers (persons who, because of their position, come to know and want to reveal information about incidents of abuse of power in the public and private sector) and leaks is extremely important, as has been shown in recent large international stories such as the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/">Panama Papers</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eic.network/projects/football-leaks.html">Football Leaks</a>, as well as Greek stories (e.g., the Lagarde list revelations and the wiretapping scandal).</p>
                <p>Through greekleaks we aim to provide a secure way for potential whistleblowers to leak information about wrongdoing in matters of public interest. More generally, and in cooperation with other bodies in Greece and abroad, we aim to stimulate public debate in Greece around the issue of whistleblowers, journalistic ethics in dealing with leaks and the legal protection of sources.</p>

                <p>We can only speculate. Others may not know that this technology exists, or it may appear overly complicated. Or perhaps it is simply a matter of differing priorities. It could also be down to a fear of receiving material that may come into conflict with the political and business relationships that many media outlets are dependent on.</p>

                <p>SecureDrop is to date considered unbreakable, but no one can guarantee 100% security. Its own FAQs states: <em>"While we can't guarantee 100% security (no organisation or product can), the goal of SecureDrop is to create a significantly more secure environment for sources to share information than exists through normal digital channels. Of course, there are always risks. That said, each release of SecureDrop with major architectural changes goes through a security audit by a reputable third party security firm."</em></p>
                <p>We must remind you that regardless of your level of familiarity with the technology, it is important to follow the guidelines carefully to achieve secure communication.</p>

                <p>In November 2022, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.odigostoupoliti.eu/nomos-4990-2022-prostasia-prosopon-pou-anaferoun-paraviaseis-enosiakou-dikaiou/">Law 4990/2022</a> on the "Protection of persons who report breaches of EU law" was passed by the Greek parliament, implementing <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L1937">EU Directive 2019/1937</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 (L 305). This law constitutes the first framework legally protecting whistleblowers, or individuals who leak information about violations of EU law in the public or private sector, in Greece. However, despite this introduction of safeguards to prevent prosecution or retaliation against these public interest whistleblowers, concerns persist that the current legal framework does not do enough to protect whistleblowers.</p>
                <p>In November 2020, Reporters United, in collaboration with Transparency International Greece, Vouliwatch and 16 other organizations launched the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/en/1769/speak-out-our-campaign-for-the-protection-of-whistleblowers-in-greece/">#Speak-out </a>initiative. As part of this project, we sent a letter to the Prime Minister, urging that a strong, inclusive, progressive and modern institutional framework be created for the protection of whistleblowers. Whistleblowing has proven a powerful tool in preventing and combating actions that undermine the public interest. Unfortunately, the Greek government <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reportersunited.gr/7220/i-elliniki-kyvernisi-afinei-aprostateytoys-toys-whistleblowers/">chose to leave whistleblowers unprotected</a> by delaying the transposition of the European directive for two whole years. Even today, following the adoption of the bill, the implementation of the legislation needs careful monitoring.</p>
